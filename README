wikipedia.rehash

wikipedia.rehash a minimal typographical rehash of Wikipedia, specifically
designed for *screen readability*. It's currently very alpha and only tested on
English, Japanese, and Chinese Wikipedia pages, but it will probably work under
most languages.

Installation
------------

If you want to try out wikipedia.rehash, you can install it by following the
steps below

1. Install Stylus [1], then open [2] in browser to install the UserCSS.
2. Install Tampermonkey [3], then open [4] in browser to install the UserScript
   (The UserScript is optional. It's a hack to fix a slight annoyance).
3. If you are not on iOS or macOS, install Charter [5], or use another typeface
   you like.
4. Open up a Wikipedia article
5. Read the source code [6] and customize it to your liking, or uninstall it if

If you don't want to use extensions, there are alternative options for each
step, see
